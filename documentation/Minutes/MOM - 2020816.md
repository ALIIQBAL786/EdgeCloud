On the part of Telefonica, it is internally evaluating to have ananswer as soon as possible. If necessary, a specific session can be establishedto discuss this point. |
| ***<span class="font" style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"><span class="size" style="font-size:11pt">DraftProposal for contributions and approval process in WG - Pull request by DT - #20</span></span>*** | DT | It is proposed to work with different subbranches. During the last two weeks, no comments have been received on what was proposed by DT, so it is assumed that all the members of this group agree with this proposal. The next step will be to move the 5GFF contribution to a subbranch and work on different branches in order to push the proposal to the master branch for approval. In parallel, the way to work to validate the 3 current proposals (MEC Contribution, 5GFF Contribution and EdgeXR Contribution) will be having technical meetings to discuss each point and have the final decision. EdgeXR is interested in managing and organizing these activities. The proposal is that Thomas Vits prepare and elaborate a first proposal for the next technical meeting during the next 2 weeks and have a status in the next bi-weekly session. Different technical activities will be worked on in parallel. |
| Next steps | EdgeXR & TEF | Telefonica and EdgeXR will discuss the next steps to follow will be discussed, beginning with the analysis with the superposition of each proposal and, as a second step, defining the Action Points to have the Edge Cloud API family with all the required functionalities, the discussion of adding or not the UNI API to the Edge Cloud API family |
