  title: OPAG-CAMARA Traffic Influence API
  description: |
    The reference scenario foresees a Service provided by many Application Server instances deployed in different geographical location (Edge sites). 
    The Traffic Influence API provides the capability to establish the best connectivity, in a specific geographical area, between the User Equipment (UE), e.g. the userâ€™s smartphone, and the optimal Application Server instance (EAS: Edge Application Server) nearby. 
    The API provides the best network quality at the Edge, establishing the fastest routing between UE and the closest EAS instance, in a specific geographical location, for a specific set of user and in a certain period of time. Considering a Service with many EASs distributed geographically, if the user (the UE) moves to another geographical area, the API can be invoked to set the network providing a new faster routing towards another EAS instance located closer to the new edge location. 
    The Service architecture foresees one or more EASs and a component, the Application Function (AF), that is the API consumer. Invoking the TI API, the AF can create a Traffic Influence resource specifying the desired request. 
    The TI API provider implements the intent specified in the Traffic Influence resource.
